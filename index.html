	<p>Coronavirus is a global virus that started in china but is still unknown why it happend or what caused it. But after 4 months the coronavirus became a huge problem for humans because some people are very paranoide about the outbreak and they stockup on needed things and there is barly any thing left in stores because of the virus. Since the virus came the government told us to stay home so the virus does not spread and you can only go if you need to go shopping for needs. </p><br><h2> Is there anything good about coronavirus?</h2>
	<p> Well there is a lot of good things about coronavirus such as since factories are shut down there are less air pollution and less green house gass and nuclear radiation and the earths o-zone is healing. oceans are geting cleaner and better and alot of animals are having fun and now since people have to stay home animals can safely give birth or lay eggs.</p><br><h2>Is there a downside of coronavirus?</h2>
